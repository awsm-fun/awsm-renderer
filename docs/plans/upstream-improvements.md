## Guiding principle (from the report — unchanged, still correct)

Most friction has one root cause: **users get pushed into dynamic (custom WGSL) materials to do things the
built-in materials should support directly** — and once there, pushed further into re-deriving lighting,
the wrong layer. So:

1. **Add the missing knobs to the built-in materials** (animatable UV transforms, more animatable params,
   texture flow). "PBR, but the texture scrolls" should be a built-in parameter, **not** a shader.
2. **Dynamic materials are for genuinely custom shading**, and must **never** require re-implementing PBR.
   Where a dynamic material needs a general building block the engine already has internally (IBL sampling,
   normal-map TBN), **expose it behind the existing `includes` gate** — small, opt-in, composable. Never
   hand people a blank shader and make them rebuild the lighting model.

## How to drive + verify this loop (MANDATORY — chrome-devtools live)

Every task is verified **in the running browser**, not just by `cargo build`. The editor dev server runs
on **http://localhost:9085** (trunk; auto-rebuilds wasm on save). The editor exposes a wasm command/query
seam on `window.wasmBindings` — drive it with chrome-devtools `evaluate_script`:

```js
// WRITE: dispatch an EditorCommand (serde-tagged JSON, same shape as the MCP EditorCommand enum)
window.wasmBindings.editor_dispatch_json(JSON.stringify({ /* { "<Variant>": { ...fields } } */ }));

// READ: run an EditorQuery and get JSON back (snapshot, diagnostics, value/pixel readback)
await window.wasmBindings.editor_query_json(JSON.stringify({ /* EditorQuery */ }));
await window.wasmBindings.editor_snapshot_json();          // whole-editor snapshot (mode/tree/selection/animation)
window.wasmBindings.editor_query_mode();                   // "scene" | "animation"
await window.wasmBindings.editor_query_scene_png();        // base64 viewport PNG (visual proof)
await window.wasmBindings.editor_query_material_png(id);   // material thumbnail PNG
await window.wasmBindings.editor_tick_animation(dt_ms);    // advance the anim clock (player-path tick)
```

**Verification protocol per task:** (1) reload `http://localhost:9085/` after the wasm rebuilds; (2) build
a minimal repro scene via `editor_dispatch_json`; (3) exercise the new behavior; (4) confirm with
`editor_query_json` readback **and** a `editor_query_scene_png` screenshot (use chrome-devtools
`take_screenshot` / read the PNG); (5) check `list_console_messages` for **zero** `GPUValidationError`
(the only benign warning is "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener"). Record the result
in the STATUS LOG.

> Save→reload via the OS File-System-Access dialog can't be driven by chrome-devtools; exercise the
> equivalent code path through `editor_dispatch_json` (e.g. the `Replace` node-sync arm) instead, and note
> the substitution.

## Task order (dependency-sequenced)

`T0` re-audited the stale claims **(DONE — see STATUS LOG)** and re-scoped what follows. Order now:
**`D2-fix` first** — T0 confirmed it's a live black-screen bug + lying diagnostics, the single
highest-impact item. Then `A1` (vec2/vec4 tracks) unblocks animating the `B1` UV offset; `B1`
settable-transform unblocks `B2`/`B3`; `D1`/`D3` are independent; `U2` is the last real UX gap.
P1, U1, U3 were **closed by T0** (not reproducible / already built).

**Order:** `T0` ✅ → `D2a` ✅ → `D2b` ⏸ → `A1` ✅ → `A2` ✅ → `B1` ✅ → `B1-anim` ✅ → `B2` ✅ → `B3` ⏸ → `D1`(ibl ✅; `D1-normalmap` ⏸) → `D3` → `P2` → `U2`.
(`B3` deferred — optional + the auto-scroll capability already works via a looping B1-anim UV-offset track;
turnkey CPU-flow design recorded. **Next: D1** — the report's "biggest win".)
(`B2` landed the universal PBR scalars (normal_scale, occlusion_strength); the type-specific knobs
(emissive_strength / alpha cutoff / toon ramp / flipbook fps·offset) are split as `B2-extra`, deferred —
each needs per-feature plumbing (extension/alpha-mode/material-type), low priority.)
(`B1` settable+UI was already built — split: `B1-anim` (animate the UV transform) is the remaining half.)
(`D2-fix` split into `D2a` (codegen black-screen — DONE) and `D2b` (diagnostics lie — DEFERRED, needs a
design decision; does not block anything). `P2` — "frame node inside subject" — was not exercised in T0;
verify it live in its own iteration. **Next actionable: `A1`.**)

---

### T0 — Re-audit the stale claims LIVE ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)

Verified live in the browser via the wasm seams. Results (full evidence in STATUS LOG):

- **D2(a) (codegen "black screen" bug) — CONFIRMED REAL, NOT fixed.** A static read was misleading: the
  struct generator emits `_pad_N: u32` members (`dynamic_layout.rs` `generate_wgsl_struct` L254-279), but
  the loader/constructor (`generate_wgsl_loader` `emit` closure L388-460) only *advances* `byte_offset`
  past the pad (L389) — it emits **no constructor argument** for the pad fields. So `[a: f32, b: vec2<f32>]`
  → struct has 3 members (`a`, `_pad_0`, `b`), constructor passes 2. **Reproduced live verbatim:**
  `GPUValidationError: structure constructor has too few inputs: expected 3, found 2 … CreateShaderModule
  "Material Opaque"` → box renders **black**, "0 buckets". The `vec3_padding_against_following_field` test
  (~L897) only checks the byte **packer**, not that the generated WGSL struct+constructor field-counts
  match — so it never caught this. → **fix in D2-fix.**
- **D2(b) (diagnostics lie) — CONFIRMED REAL.** With the broken material assigned and the GPU error
  spewing each frame, `editor_query_json { material_diagnostics }` still returned
  `{ registered:true, ok:true, errors:[] }` (`query.rs` `CompileDiagnostics` L85-91). The async GPU
  pipeline-creation outcome is not reflected. → **fix in D2-fix.**
- **P1 (camera locked in clip mode) — CLOSED (not reproducible).** With a clip made current
  (`set_current_clip`), `set_camera_orbit` from pose A→B visibly moved the view (3/4 → top-down, zoomed
  out, screenshot-confirmed). Camera control is not gated by clip mode. No action.
- **U1 / U3 (add-track affordance) — CLOSED (already built).** In animation mode the "Add Track" button is
  prominent in the top bar **and** as the empty-state CTA ("Add a track to bind a bone, morph weight, or
  material uniform"); `animation_mode/add_track.rs` covers Transform/Light/Camera/BuiltinParam/Morph/Uniform.
  Only residual: **morph index >0** is capped at 0 (`add_track.rs` L18-21) — folded into **U2**.
- **U2 (outliner in animation) — CONFIRMED STILL MISSING.** The animation-mode left rail shows only the
  clip list ("Animations"), no scene-tree. Remains a real task below.

---

### A1 — Add `vec2` / `vec4` keyframe + uniform-track value kinds ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)

**Landed + verified live.** Added `Vec2([f32;2])` / `Vec4([f32;4])` to `TrackValue` (`scene/animation.rs`)
and to the renderer's `AnimationData` with linear + cubic interpolation (`animation/data.rs` +
`interpolate.rs`); threaded through lowering (`scene_loader.rs` + editor `controller/animation.rs`),
the uniform conversion (`animations.rs data_to_uniform_value`), and the editor UI (keyframe-value editor +
`tv_component`/`tv_with_component` in `inspector.rs`; curve `Arity::Vec2/Vec4` + channels + sampling in
`timeline/curves.rs`; readback coercion + `zeroed_like`). Live verification surfaced **two gaps unit tests
could not catch**, now fixed: (1) the NLA mixer's `blend_replace`/`blend_additive` (`animation/blend.rs`)
handled only F32/F64/Vec3/Quat and silently returned the unchanged rest (`_ => acc.clone()`) for Vec2/Vec4;
(2) `read_rest` (`animations.rs`) seeded a **Vec4** uniform's rest as `AnimationData::Quat` (a slerp on a
non-rotation value) and ignored Vec2 — so the mixer blend fell through. Both now seed/blend Vec2/Vec4 as
component-lerped values.

**Verified live (editor :9085):** a single `Vec4` uniform track (`tint` red `[1,0,0,1]` @0 → blue
`[0,0,1,1]` @1) on a custom material (`input.material.tint.rgb`) scrubs **red → magenta `[0.5,0,0.5]` @0.5
→ blue** — screenshot-confirmed at all three playhead positions, region-luma changes (131→63→110), zero
GPUValidationError. Round-trip + interpolation + conversion unit tests added/extended (scene round-trip
incl. Vec2/Vec4; 44 renderer animation tests green).

---

#### A1 (original spec — for reference)

**Verified state — STILL-VALID.** `TrackValue` is `Vec3 | Quat | Scalar`
(`packages/crates/scene/src/animation.rs` L58-65). Uniforms already support `Vec2`/`Vec4`
(`scene/src/dynamic_material.rs` `UniformValue` L152-180), but the animation→uniform conversion rejects
anything but F32/Vec3/Quat (`packages/crates/renderer/src/animation/animations.rs` L238-254, `WrongKind`).

**Do.** Add `Vec2([f32;2])` and `Vec4([f32;4])` to `TrackValue`; thread them through: the curves/sampler
interpolation (`packages/crates/curves/`), the animation→uniform conversion map (`animations.rs` L238),
the MCP `TrackValue` mirror + (de)serialization (`packages/mcp/editor-protocol/src/command.rs`), and the
editor inspector/keyframe widgets. Componentwise lerp for Vec2/Vec4; cubic if the sampler supports it.

**Verify (live).** Create a clip, add a uniform/material track, `AddKeyframe` a `Vec2` and a `Vec4` value,
`editor_tick_animation` across the keys, and `editor_query_json` the interpolated value at a mid-time —
confirm it matches componentwise lerp. Screenshot a scene whose visible param is a Vec2/Vec4 track.

**Done when:** a single Vec2 track (not two scalars) drives a uniform end-to-end, verified live; no GPU error.

---

### A2 — Accept an optional `interp` on `add_keyframe` ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)

**Landed + verified live.** Added `#[serde(default)] interp: Option<Interp>` to `AddKeyframe`
(`editor-protocol/command.rs`); the handler (`controller/state.rs`) uses it when `Some`, else derives from
the track sampler (so existing callers are unchanged). Updated the 3 editor construction sites
(`inspector.rs`, `timeline/transport.rs`, `gizmo.rs`) to pass `interp: None`, and the MCP tool
(`mcp.rs add_keyframe` + `AddKeyframeParams.interp: Option<String>` parsed via the existing `parse_interp`).
Also completed A1's MCP surface: `build_track_value` now accepts `vec2`/`vec4` (the tool description lists
`vec2 | vec3 | vec4 | quat | scalar`). Verified live (editor :9085): three keys added in one call each →
readback `["step","linear","cubic"]` (explicit step@0, no-arg→sampler linear@0.5, explicit cubic@1); no
GPU errors. No follow-up `SetKeyframe` needed.

---

#### A2 (original spec — for reference)

**Verified state — STILL-VALID but tiny.** `AddKeyframe` has no `interp`
(`packages/mcp/editor-protocol/src/command.rs` ~L674); the handler derives interp from the track sampler
(`controller/state.rs` `sampler_to_interp`). `SetKeyframe` **already** carries `interp: Option<Interp>`
(command.rs ~L698), so setting it today needs a second call.

**Do.** Add `#[serde(default)] interp: Option<Interp>` to `AddKeyframe`; in the handler, use it when
`Some`, else fall back to the sampler default. Reuse the existing `Interp` type — no new plumbing.

**Verify (live).** `AddKeyframe` with `interp: "step"` via `editor_dispatch_json`, then `editor_query_json`
the keyframe and confirm its interp is `step` without a follow-up `SetKeyframe`.

**Done when:** one `AddKeyframe` call sets a non-default interp, verified by readback.

---

### B1 — Per-texture UV transform: settable + editor UI ✅ DONE (pre-existing; re-verified by code map)

**Re-audit corrected the report.** The report's "built-in materials expose NO UV transform at all" is
**stale** — per-texture offset/scale/rotation is already a first-class, settable, editor-editable feature:

- **Scene model:** `primitive.rs` `TextureRef { asset, uv_index, transform: Option<TextureTransform>,
  sampler }` with `TextureTransform { offset, rotation, scale }` (default scale `[1,1]`); referenced by
  every `MaterialDef` texture slot in `scene/material.rs` (base_color / metallic_roughness / normal /
  occlusion / emissive). Serialized to the project.
- **Renderer:** `TextureTransform { offset, origin, rotation, scale }` (`renderer/textures.rs` ~L805) +
  `insert_texture_transform` / `update_texture_transform` (live, repacks GPU bytes + dirties for re-upload);
  per-texture `MaterialTexture::transform_key` (`materials/texture.rs` L18); the WGSL applies it in
  `shared_wgsl/textures.wgsl` `texture_transform_uvs` (affine M·uv + B). KHR_texture_transform round-trips
  on glTF import (`renderer-gltf/populate/material.rs`).
- **Editor UI (already built):** `scene_mode/inspector.rs` `texture_slot_rows` (~L2917) exposes per-slot
  **UV set, Offset X/Y, Rotation, Scale X/Y, Wrap U/V**; each edit commits to `TextureRef.transform`, and
  the material bridge (`engine/bridge/material.rs` ~L350) materializes it into a renderer
  `TextureTransform` key. So scrolling/rotating a built-in texture by hand is a built-in feature today.

**Remaining gap → split out as `B1-anim` (next task).** The only missing half of the report's B1 is the
**animation-track target** for the UV transform. That's a sizable, self-contained feature (its own task,
below), so B1's settable+UI half is marked done here and the animation half is `B1-anim`.

---

### B1-anim — Animate the per-texture UV transform (offset/scale/rotation) ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)

**Landed + verified live.** Implemented exactly the mapped design: renderer `Textures` SlotMap now stores
the `TextureTransform` (+ `get_texture_transform`) for read-modify-write; `AnimationTarget::TextureUv {
material, slot, prop }` + `TexSlot`/`TexTransformProp` enums (renderer + scene mirrors); the apply
(`animations.rs apply_texture_uv`) resolves the slot's `transform_key`, **seeds an identity transform on
demand** if the slot has a texture but none yet, then writes the driven component (offset/scale = vec2 via
A1, rotation = scalar) and re-uploads; `read_rest` seeds from the slot's current component; lowering in
both the player path (`scene-loader/animation.rs`) and editor (`animation_sync.rs resolve_target`, node →
first material key); editor display/label/default sites + an Add-Track row group (Base-Color UV
Offset/Scale/Rotation); MCP `build_track_value` already does vec2 (A2). 311 unit tests green (renderer +
scene + scene-loader).

**Verified live (editor :9085):** imported `BoxTextured.glb` (real textured built-in PBR), added a
`texture_transform / base_color / offset` track (vec2 `[0,0]`@0 → `[1,0]`@1), scrubbed → the texture
**visibly scrolls in U** (t=0 vs t=0.5 screenshots, pattern shifted half-width), zero GPUValidationError.
The imported texture had no prior transform, so this also proves the on-demand identity-seed path.

---

#### B1-anim (original design — for reference)

**Verified state — STILL-VALID (no UV-transform animation target exists).** `TrackTarget`
(`scene/animation.rs`) and renderer `AnimationTarget` (`clip_group.rs`) have Transform/Morph/Uniform/
BuiltinParam/Light/Camera but **no texture-transform target**; `add_track.rs` lists no UV-transform rows.

**Design (extension points mapped — turnkey).**
1. **Renderer foundation:** change `Textures::texture_transforms` from `SlotMap<K, ()>` to
   `SlotMap<K, TextureTransform>` (store the struct), and add `get_texture_transform(key) -> Option<&_>` +
   have `update_texture_transform` keep the CPU mirror in sync — so a track can read-modify-write ONE
   component while preserving the others. (This 3-line change was prototyped + reverted to keep B1's commit
   clean; re-apply it as step 1.)
2. **scene:** `TrackTarget::TextureTransform { node, slot: TexSlot, prop: TexTransformProp }` with new
   `TexSlot` (BaseColor/MetallicRoughness/Normal/Occlusion/Emissive — mirror of `BuiltinTextureSlot`, but
   defined in `scene` since `editor-protocol` depends on `scene`, not vice-versa) and `TexTransformProp`
   (Offset → vec2 (**A1**), Scale → vec2, Rotation → scalar).
3. **renderer:** `AnimationTarget::TextureUv { material: MaterialKey, slot, prop }`; apply reads the
   material's slot `MaterialTexture` (`PbrMaterial.base_color_tex` etc. — `materials/pbr.rs` L22+) for its
   `transform_key`, **ensuring an identity key exists** (insert + assign if `None`), then
   `get_texture_transform` → set the animated component → `update_texture_transform`. Mind the borrow split
   (mutate `materials` to read the key, then mutate `textures`). `read_rest` returns the slot transform's
   current component. The mixer already blends vec2/scalar (A1).
4. **editor lowering:** `animation_sync.rs resolve_target` — new arm: node → first `material_key` (like
   `BuiltinParam`), emit `AnimationTarget::TextureUv`.
5. **editor UI:** `add_track.rs` — per-textured-slot rows (Offset/Scale/Rotation) under the material group.

**Verify (live).** Built-in PBR mesh + base-color texture (procedural checker): animate the base-color UV
**offset** as a single Vec2 track → `editor_tick_animation`/scrub → screenshots over time show the texture
scrolling; confirm the normal-map slot's transform is independent (per-texture). No GPU error.

**Done when:** a built-in texture's UV offset (and scale/rotation) is animatable per slot, proven by
over-time screenshots; settable half already verified above.

---

### B2 — Broaden the animatable/settable built-in material params ✅ DONE (PBR scalars; type-specific → B2-extra)

**Landed + verified live.** Added `NormalScale` + `OcclusionStrength` to both `BuiltinParamKind` (scene)
and `BuiltinMaterialParam` (renderer) — the always-present PBR scalars — wired uniformly as **settable AND
animatable** (the report's "same list" principle): scene `patch_builtin_param` + renderer
`apply_builtin_material_param` + `read_rest` + the `builtin_param()` resolvers (scene-loader + editor) +
the `BuiltinParam` readback + the Add-Track rows + the MCP `set_builtin_param` tool
(`BuiltinParamArg` + description). 311 unit tests green.

**Verified live (editor :9085):** imported `NormalTangentTest.glb` (normal-mapped built-in PBR). Settable:
`set_builtin_param(normal_scale, 0)` → `node_kind_details` readback shows `normal_scale: 0`. Animatable: a
`builtin_param/normal_scale` track `3.0`@0 → `0.0`@1 scrubbed → the normal-mapped detail visibly
**flattens** (t=0 bumpy spheres vs t=1 flat quads, screenshots), zero GPUValidationError.

**Split — `B2-extra` (DEFERRED, low priority):** `emissive_strength`, alpha `cutoff`, toon ramp knobs
(diffuse bands / specular steps / shininess / rim), and flipbook `fps`/`time_offset` are NOT plain
`MaterialDef` scalars — each needs per-feature plumbing (emissive_strength is an `Option<…>` extension →
creating it changes the shader feature-set / recompiles; cutoff lives on the alpha mode; toon/flipbook are
material-type-specific fields). Add them the same way (enum arm + apply + resolver + readback + UI) when
prioritized.

---

#### B2 (original spec — for reference)

**Verified state — STILL-VALID.** Only `BaseColor | Metallic | Roughness | Emissive` are animatable, in
two enums + one resolver that must stay in sync: `BuiltinParamKind`
(`packages/crates/scene/src/animation.rs` L86-94), `BuiltinMaterialParam`
(`packages/crates/renderer/src/animation/clip_group.rs` L84-96), and `builtin_param()`
(`packages/crates/scene-loader/src/animation.rs` L261-268).

**Do.** Treat "settable param" and "animatable track target" as the **same list**. Add the natural knobs:
`normal_scale`, `emissive_strength`, `occlusion_strength`, alpha cutoff; toon ramp knobs (diffuse bands,
specular steps, shininess, rim strength/power — see `materials/src/toon.rs`); flipbook `fps` / `time_offset`
/ `frame_count` (`materials/src/flipbook.rs` L78-99). Extend both enums + the resolver together, the MCP
`SetBuiltinParam`/readback, and the Add-Track BuiltinParam list (`add_track.rs` L510-558).

**Verify (live).** For each new param: set it via dispatch → screenshot reflects the change; animate it →
ticked screenshots show it moving. Spot-check a toon material and a flipbook material specifically.

**Done when:** the new params are settable + animatable, each verified live; no GPU error.

---

### B3 — First-class texture `flow` (direction + speed), advanced automatically ⏸ DEFERRED (optional; covered by B1-anim)

**Why deferred (value call, not difficulty).** The report marks B3 **optional** ("B1 is the load-bearing
part"), and its user-facing capability — an auto-scrolling texture — is **already delivered and
live-verified via B1-anim**: a looping UV-offset track (offset `[0,0]→[1,0]`, clip loop) scrolls a
built-in texture with zero shader work (proven live on `BoxTextured.glb`). B3 only adds the *convenience*
of "set a velocity, runtime auto-advances, no clip authored." Given the remaining higher-value items —
**D1** (the report's "biggest win"), D3, P2, U2 — in this long autonomous session, B3 is deferred. The
design below is turnkey; pick it up when the convenience is prioritized.

**Design (CPU-flow — chosen over shader-flow).** A shader-flow (`offset += flow * frame_time` in
`textures.wgsl`) was ruled out: `frame_globals_raw` is bound at *different* bindings per pass and
`textures.wgsl` is pass-agnostic (shared into shadow/prepass), so it can't portably reach frame time.
Instead, advance on the CPU:
1. **scene:** `TextureRef.flow: Option<[f32; 2]>` (UV/sec velocity), serde-default `None`.
2. **renderer:** a `SecondaryMap<TextureTransformKey, { base_offset: [f32;2], flow: [f32;2], elapsed: f32 }>`
   on `Textures` + `set_texture_flow(key, base_offset, flow)` + `advance_texture_flows(dt)` that recomputes
   `offset = base_offset + flow * elapsed` (recompute-from-base, NOT accumulate — no drift) and calls
   `update_texture_transform`. Hook `advance_texture_flows(dt)` into `update_animations` (already the
   per-frame tick). Only flowing slots write — no per-frame cost otherwise.
3. **bridge** (`engine/bridge/material.rs`): when materializing a slot whose `TextureRef.flow` is `Some`,
   register it after creating the `transform_key`.
4. **editor UI:** a per-slot Flow X/Y field in `texture_slot_rows` (mirrors offset/scale); **MCP**: extend
   the texture-bind command or add a set-flow command.
5. **Verify live** (feasible despite the SetKind path): import a textured glb → `node_kind_details` to read
   the node's kind blob → set `base_color_texture.flow` → `SetKind` back → `editor_tick_animation` → ticked
   screenshots show the texture scrolling with no clip.

> **B3-extra (also deferred):** the editor **detect-and-warn** for meshes with no continuous UV axis along
> the scroll direction (baked/tiled atlas geometry) — a separate UV-parameterization analysis.

**(original "Do" — for reference)** A thin convenience over **B1**: a per-texture-slot `flow` param
(direction `vec2` + speed) that the runtime advances each frame by accumulating into the slot's UV offset
(reuse B1's transform — flow is just an auto-driver of `offset`). Expose from the param API + GUI.

> **Surface the content caveat in tooling:** UV-scroll only works when the mesh has a continuous UV axis
> along the scroll direction. Baked/tiled geometry (e.g. a tank tread of separate cleat-links sharing one
> atlas patch) has no such axis — scrolling walks off into unrelated atlas regions. Add an editor
> **detect-and-warn** ("this mesh has no continuous UV parameterization along U/V") so users don't chase an
> effect the geometry can't support.

**Verify (live).** Set `flow` on a textured plane → without any manual keyframes, ticked screenshots show
the texture moving at the set speed/direction. Confirm two slots can flow at different speeds.

**Done when:** flow auto-scrolls a built-in texture with no animation track, verified over time; the
no-continuous-UV warning fires on a baked-UV mesh.

### D1 — Expose `ibl` and `normal_map`/TBN building blocks behind `includes` gates (biggest item) ✅ ibl DONE; `normal_map` → D1-normalmap

**`ibl` include — LANDED + verified live (2026-06-21).** The report's "single biggest win." Added a Tier-A
`ibl` include: new bit `BIT_IBL` + `ShaderIncludes::IBL` + `KEY_TABLE` row + `all()` membership +
`direct_deps` (→ LIGHT_ACCESS/MATH/CAMERA) in `materials/src/shader_includes.rs`; an `ibl: bool` gate in
`ShaderIncludeFlags` (`dynamic_materials/registry.rs`, Tier-A so `for_custom` keeps it); a self-contained
`shared_wgsl/lighting/ibl.wgsl` exposing `sample_ibl(albedo, normal, view, roughness, metallic)` (+
`sample_ibl_diffuse`/`_specular`) over the **always-bound** IBL cubemaps + BRDF LUT + `get_lights_info().ibl`
mip counts (split-sum; NOT a PBR re-implementation); gated into the opaque kernel
(`opaque_kernel_includes.wgsl`). Added a `naga_validate` regression test
(`custom_material_ibl_include_validates`) — the assembled Custom kernel with `ibl` + a `sample_ibl` call
validates across all AA/mip configs.

**Verified live (editor :9085):** built-in IBL environment (`set_environment` BuiltInDefault), a custom
material declaring `includes:["ibl"]` whose fragment returns ONLY `sample_ibl(albedo=orange, world_normal,
surface_to_camera, 0.35, 0)`, **no reliance on punctual lights** → the box is **lit by the environment**
(orange with sky-irradiance directional shading, NOT black), `ok:true`, zero GPUValidationError. This is
exactly the report's repro fixed.

**`normal_map`/TBN → split as `D1-normalmap` (DEFERRED).** The dynamic `OpaqueShadingInput` has **no
`tangents` field** (`opaque_kernel_includes.wgsl` L165+) — built-in PBR gets its TBN from the geometry pass,
but the custom wrapper isn't handed tangents. So a `normal_map`/TBN helper first needs **tangents plumbed
into the dynamic input**: fetch+interpolate the vertex tangent at the barycentric shade point in the
visibility-buffer compute kernel (analogous to `world_normal`), gated on the material requesting
`FragmentInputs::TANGENTS`, then add a `normal_map` Tier-A include with `build_tbn(world_normal, tangent)` /
`perturb_normal(tangent_sample, world_normal, tangent)`. That's kernel attribute work (moderate), separable
from the ibl win — deferred. (Original combined spec below.)

---

#### D1 (original combined spec — for reference)

**Verified state — STILL-VALID.** The `includes` gate exists with a `KEY_TABLE`
(`packages/crates/materials/src/shader_includes.rs` L165-238); dynamic materials get the Tier-A set
(math, camera, color_space, textures, vertex_color, light_access, shadows, skybox, extras —
`materials/src/dynamic.rs` L183-189). `light_access` is **punctual-only** (`get_lights_info` / `get_light`
/ `light_sample` — `renderer/src/render_passes/shared/shared_wgsl/lighting/light_access.wgsl` L18-126), so
in an IBL-lit scene with no punctual lights a dynamic material renders ~black while built-in PBR beside it
is lit. The BRDF/IBL **primitives exist** but only inside the Tier-B aggregate (`brdf.wgsl`,
`apply_lighting`, `material_color_calc` are marked `tier_a: false`) — not split into a gatable include.
`tangents` is available as a fragment input but **no TBN matrix / `perturb_normal` helper** is exposed.

**Do.**
- **`ibl` include** — split the IBL primitives (diffuse irradiance + specular prefilter + BRDF-LUT lookup)
  out of the Tier-B BRDF aggregate into a small Tier-A include exposing `sample_ibl(normal, roughness)`
  (and the pieces). Add the key to `KEY_TABLE`, gate its cost so it's only paid when requested. This is a
  general primitive, **not** a PBR re-implementation (explicitly do NOT add a "reimplement/fork PBR"
  helper).
- **`normal_map` / TBN include** — supply a TBN when `tangents` is requested, and/or a
  `perturb_normal(sample)` helper. Note the opaque compute kernel samples LOD0 with no hardware
  derivatives, so the TBN must come from the requested `tangents` input, not `dpdx/dpdy`.

**Verify (live).** Build an IBL-only scene (environment, **no** punctual lights). Add a built-in PBR mesh
(lit) and a dynamic material that opts into `ibl` and calls `sample_ibl` — screenshot: the dynamic mesh is
lit comparably, **not black**. Then a dynamic material opting into `normal_map`/TBN with a normal texture —
screenshot shows correct tangent-space perturbation. No GPU error.

**Done when:** both includes work from a custom material in a real IBL scene, screenshot-proven, without
re-deriving PBR.

---

### D2a — Fix the padding-codegen "black screen" bug ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)

**Was CONFIRMED REAL (T0, live), now FIXED + verified live.** Any custom-material uniform layout needing
alignment padding (`f32` before `vec2`/`vec3`/`vec4`, `vec2` before `vec4`, …) generated a `MaterialData`
struct with `_pad_N` members but a constructor that omitted them → naga rejected the "Material Opaque"
module → every mesh on that kernel rendered black.

**Fix landed.** `generate_wgsl_loader`'s `emit` closure (`packages/crates/materials/src/dynamic_layout.rs`
~L388) now emits a literal `0u` constructor argument for **each pad word** it skips during alignment,
mirroring the `_pad_N` members `generate_wgsl_struct` emits — so the positional arg list matches the struct
member list exactly. Walks the same gap arithmetic in both functions.

**Regression test landed.** `loader_constructor_arg_count_matches_struct_members_with_padding` in
`dynamic_layout.rs` asserts struct-member-count == constructor-arg-count for `[f32,vec2]`, `[f32,vec3]`,
`[f32,vec4]`, `[vec2,vec4]`, and a padded-uniforms-then-texture/buffer tail, plus that a `0u, // _pad`
placeholder is emitted. (The old `vec3_padding_against_following_field` test only checked the byte packer,
never the struct-vs-constructor field counts — which is why this slipped through.) FAILS before the fix,
passes after; all 15 `dynamic_layout` tests green.

**Verified live.** The exact T0 repro (`[a: f32, b: vec2<f32>]` custom material on a box) now renders the
shaded **orange** `OpaqueShadingOutput` color, **zero** `GPUValidationError` in the console (was the
"too few inputs: expected 3, found 2" error), `min_luma` 0 → 187 (no black region).

---

### D2b — Make material diagnostics reflect the REAL GPU compile outcome ⏸ DEFERRED (needs design)

**Verified state — CONFIRMED REAL (live), and BROADER than the report implied.** Even with D2a fixed, a
custom material whose **author body** is GPU-invalid (e.g. `return OpaqueShadingOutput(
this_symbol_does_not_exist, 1.0)` — passes the trailing-`;` syntax pre-check, fails naga/Tint) still
reports `material_diagnostics → { registered:true, ok:true, errors:[] }` while the console shows
`GPUValidationError: unresolved value … CreateShaderModule "Material Opaque"`. So the lie is any deferred
GPU module-compile failure, not just the codegen class.

**Why it's deferred (attempted fix didn't resolve the symptom — reverted).** I tried the obvious renderer
fix: in the OpaqueDynamic compile future (`pipeline_scheduler/launch.rs` ~L613, `ensure_bucket_pipelines`),
call `shader_compile_diagnostic` (→ `renderer-core/shaders.rs` `get_compilation_info_ext`, the real Tint
`getCompilationInfo`) on the **success** path too and force the failure arm when it reports errors. Built it,
verified live: the material STILL reported `ok:true` across a 6 s poll, and the per-frame
`GPUValidationError` persisted — so `mark_failed` never fired for the material. Reverted (it added a
`getCompilationInfo` to every successful compile for no proven benefit). Three compounding blockers, each
needing a decision:
  1. **Two compile paths, only one attributable.** The error reliably surfaces on the *edge-resolve* pipeline
     (`launch_edge_resolve_compile` ~L844-866, charged to `Pass(MaterialEdgeResolve)`, logged-and-dropped at
     ~L951) — NOT on the per-material OpaqueDynamic path. Either the opaque pipeline resolves `Ok` (WebGPU
     deferred-error model) so its `getCompilationInfo` came back empty at await time, or it was a
     cache-hit/skip so my future never ran. Needs instrumentation to confirm which.
  2. **Shared kernel module.** The "Material Opaque" module concatenates EVERY enabled dynamic material's
     `wgsl_fragment` (`material_opaque/shader/template.rs` ~L46), so one bad fragment breaks the shared
     module and the failure isn't cleanly attributable to a single material id at the GPU layer.
  3. **Editor-side diagnostics caching.** `material_diagnostics` reads `mat.last_diagnostics`
     (`controller/state.rs` ~L3743), which is written ONLY inside `register_material`'s ~1.9 s
     `await_dynamic_compile` poll window (~L5696-5764). A failure that resolves after that window is lost
     until the next edit — so even a working `mark_failed` can be missed on timing.

**Recommended design (decision needed before implementing).** Stop fighting WebGPU's async deferred-error
model; validate **synchronously at register time, in-wasm, per material**: assemble a single-material opaque
kernel (exactly as `renderer/src/wgsl_validation.rs` `custom_key` does for the native tests) and run
**naga** (`parse_str` + `Validator`) on it; surface any error into `last_diagnostics` with the message.
naga is pure Rust and already a dev-dep — the open decision is **accepting naga as a runtime dependency of
the editor wasm bundle** (binary-size cost) vs. a lighter path (e.g. a persistent device error-scope around
the dynamic module creation, correlated to the in-flight material; or having the query re-consult the live
renderer compile status instead of the cached `last_diagnostics`). This is a design call for David, not a
blind code change — hence deferred rather than forced GREEN.

**Done when:** (after the design decision) diagnostics report `ok:false` (with the message) for any material
that fails GPU pipeline/module creation, and `ok:true` only when it genuinely compiles — verified live.

> Note: D2a (the actual black-screen bug — the high-impact half) is FIXED + committed. D2b is a
> diagnostics-truthfulness improvement, not a rendering bug; deferring it does not block any other task.

### D3 — Setting a material uniform must affect the LIVE value, not only the default

**Verified state — STILL-VALID at the editor/MCP layer.** `SetMaterialUniform` is documented as setting
the **default** value of a declared slot (`packages/mcp/editor-protocol/src/command.rs` L558-561), so a
write only takes effect on re-register or via an animation track. The renderer *has* a live path
(`AwsmRenderer::update_material` callback repacks the uniform buffer each prep —
`packages/crates/renderer/src/materials.rs` L70-83), but the editor command writes the default and
re-registers rather than writing the live buffer.

**Do.** Route `SetMaterialUniform` through the live `update_material` path so the value writes the live
uniform buffer and shows immediately (no re-register). If both semantics are wanted, keep "default" and
add an explicit live variant — but the report's ask is that the existing setter previews live; prefer
making it live and documenting it.

**Verify (live).** Register a custom material with a color uniform, assign to a mesh, `SetMaterialUniform`
a new color → screenshot updates **without** re-register; `editor_query_json` Uniform readback matches.

**Done when:** a uniform write changes the render immediately, screenshot-proven.

---

### P1 — Camera control / gizmo in clip-edit mode  ✅ CLOSED by T0 (not reproducible)

T0 confirmed camera orbit works while a clip is current (pose A→B moved the view, screenshot-proven), so
the reported lock does not reproduce on the current build. No action. (If a user re-reports it, capture the
exact gesture — it may have been an interactive mouse-drag capture issue in an older build, not the orbit
command path.)

---

### P2 — "Frame node" can place the camera inside the subject

**Verified state — PARTIAL.** The fit uses `frame_aabb(aabb, 1.15×)` (`controller/state.rs` FrameNode
handler) with breathing room but **no min-distance clamp**; the fit math lives in the external
`awsm_web_shared` camera lib (`FreeCamera::frame_aabb`), so a large/odd-aspect subject can still seat the
camera inside the bounds.

**Do.** Add a min-distance clamp (and/or revisit the fit so distance derives from the bounding sphere +
vertical FOV with a floor that keeps the camera outside the AABB). If `frame_aabb` is in the external lib,
apply the clamp at the editor call site or extend the lib call.

**Verify (live).** `FrameNode` on a large mesh → screenshot shows a proper fit (whole subject visible),
not an interior close-up. Repeat on a small mesh (still framed reasonably).

**Done when:** framing a large subject never lands inside it, screenshot-proven on big + small meshes.

---

### U2 — Bring an outliner / scene-tree into the animation context (shared selection)

**Verified state — MISSING (the one real UX gap left).** A full outliner exists in scene mode
(`packages/frontend/editor/src/scene_mode/outliner.rs`) but the animation-mode workspace left column shows
only ClipLibrary + KeyInspector (`animation_mode/workspace.rs` L17-33) — no scene-tree, no visible
selection context, so you can't see what a track binds to. (U1/U3 are already addressed — see T0.)

**Do.** Surface a collapsible outliner / scene-tree in the animation workspace, reusing the scene-mode
outliner component. Make selection **visible and shared** between scene and animation editing, and wire it
to drive the selection-aware Add-Track flow (pick node → choose property → add track). Optionally lift the
morph index>0 cap if the mesh's morph-target count can be exposed to the editor `Node` (`add_track.rs`
L18-21).

**Verify (live).** In animation mode: the outliner is visible; selecting a node there highlights it and
the Add-Track picker is scoped to it; selecting a track shows which node it binds to. Confirm selection
matches `editor_snapshot_json`'s `selection`.

**Done when:** animation mode shows a working, selection-shared outliner, verified via snapshot + UI.

## STATUS LOG (append after each task — this is the loop's running record)

> Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — <task> — PASS/CHANGED/CLOSED — <one-line live evidence (screenshot/readback + no GPU error)>`

- 2026-06-21 — plan rewritten from the stale third-party handoff; all items re-verified against branch
  `improvements` code; live-drive harness (`window.wasmBindings.editor_*`) confirmed working on :9085.
- 2026-06-21 — **T0 re-audit DONE (live).** Built Box+DirLight via `editor_dispatch_json`; results:
  - **D2(a) CONFIRMED REAL** — custom material layout `[a: f32, b: vec2<f32>]` assigned to the box →
    `GPUValidationError: structure constructor has too few inputs: expected 3, found 2 … CreateShaderModule
    "Material Opaque"` (console), box rendered **black**, "0 buckets". Root cause read in
    `dynamic_layout.rs`: `generate_wgsl_struct` emits `_pad_N` members but `generate_wgsl_loader` omits the
    matching constructor args. Not covered by existing packer tests.
  - **D2(b) CONFIRMED REAL** — `material_diagnostics` returned `{registered:true, ok:true, errors:[]}` for
    that same broken material while the GPU error spewed each frame. Diagnostics lie.
  - **P1 CLOSED** — with a clip current, `set_camera_orbit` A→B visibly moved the viewport (screenshots).
    Not reproducible.
  - **U1/U3 CLOSED** — "Add Track" affordance prominent in animation mode (top bar + empty-state CTA),
    `add_track.rs` covers all target families. Residual morph-index>0 cap folded into U2.
  - **U2 STILL MISSING** — animation-mode left rail is clip-list only; no scene-tree outliner.
  - Re-scoped: D2-fix promoted to first real task; P1/U1/U3 closed. Next: D2-fix.
- 2026-06-21 — **D2a DONE (codegen black-screen fix) — PASS (live).** Fixed `generate_wgsl_loader` to emit
  a `0u` constructor arg per pad word (mirrors `_pad_N` struct members); added regression test
  `loader_constructor_arg_count_matches_struct_members_with_padding` (all 15 dynamic_layout tests green).
  Live: the T0 `[f32, vec2<f32>]` repro now renders the orange `OpaqueShadingOutput` color (was black),
  `min_luma` 0→187, **zero** GPUValidationError. Diagnostics correctly `ok:true` for the now-valid material.
  Commit: materials crate only.
- 2026-06-21 — **D2b SPLIT OUT (diagnostics lie) — still OPEN, root-caused live.** Found the lie is broader
  than the codegen case: a GPU-invalid *author body* (`unresolved value …` at CreateShaderModule
  "Material Opaque") still reports `{ok:true,errors:[]}`. Root cause: the dynamic shade pipeline's async
  creation resolves `Ok` despite the invalid module (WebGPU deferred-error model); only the edge-resolve
  failure is logged (`launch.rs` ~L951, not attributed to a material), so the group never goes `Failed` and
  the `await_dynamic_compile` poll times out → optimistic `ok:true`. Fix = validate compilation-info on the
  success path (`renderer-core/shaders.rs` `get_compilation_info_ext`) and propagate. Next iteration: D2b.
- 2026-06-21 — **D2b DEFERRED (needs design) — attempted fix reverted.** Implemented the success-path
  `getCompilationInfo` check in the OpaqueDynamic compile future (`launch.rs` ~L613) + force-Err; built &
  tested LIVE: invalid-body material STILL reported `ok:true` across a 6 s poll and the per-frame
  GPUValidationError persisted → `mark_failed` never fired for the material. Reverted (overhead, no benefit).
  Root-caused 3 compounding blockers: (1) the failure surfaces only on the non-attributable edge-resolve
  pipeline, not the per-material opaque one; (2) the "Material Opaque" module is SHARED across all dynamic
  fragments, so GPU-layer attribution is ambiguous; (3) `material_diagnostics` reads the editor-cached
  `last_diagnostics`, written only inside `register_material`'s ~1.9 s poll window. Recommended design:
  synchronous per-material naga validation at register (as `wgsl_validation.rs custom_key` does natively) —
  pending a decision on naga-as-runtime-wasm-dep vs. a lighter error-scope/live-status approach. Not a
  rendering bug and blocks nothing. **Proceeding to A1.**
- 2026-06-21 — **A1 DONE (vec2/vec4 keyframe + uniform-track value kinds) — PASS (live).** Added Vec2/Vec4
  to `TrackValue` + `AnimationData` (+ linear/cubic interp), lowering, uniform conversion, and the editor UI
  (keyframe editor, curve arity/sampling, readback). Live verification caught + fixed two gaps unit tests
  missed: the mixer `blend_replace`/`blend_additive` and `read_rest` both lacked Vec2/Vec4 (Vec4 rest was
  wrongly seeded as Quat → slerp on a non-rotation value). Verified live: a Vec4 `tint` track red→blue scrubs
  through magenta `[0.5,0,0.5]` at the midpoint (3 screenshots + region-luma 131→63→110), zero GPU errors.
  Tests: scene round-trip extended (Vec2/Vec4), 44 renderer animation tests green. Next: A2.
- 2026-06-21 — **A2 DONE (optional interp on add_keyframe) — PASS (live).** Added `interp: Option<Interp>`
  to `AddKeyframe` (serde default) + handler fallback to the track sampler; updated 3 editor call sites + the
  MCP tool/params; also finished A1's MCP `build_track_value` (vec2/vec4). Verified live: 3 keys in one call
  each → readback `["step","linear","cubic"]`, zero GPU errors, clean compile (no warnings). Next: B1.
- 2026-06-21 — **B1 (settable + editor UI) DONE — already built (code-confirmed), report was STALE.**
  Deep code map (Explore) found per-texture offset/scale/rotation is fully present: scene `TextureRef.transform`
  (`primitive.rs`) on every `MaterialDef` slot; renderer `TextureTransform` + `insert/update_texture_transform`
  (live) + `MaterialTexture.transform_key` + the `texture_transform_uvs` WGSL; KHR import round-trips; and the
  editor inspector `texture_slot_rows` already exposes UV-set/Offset X·Y/Rotation/Scale X·Y/Wrap per slot,
  committing to `TextureRef.transform` via the material bridge. So the report's "no UV transform at all" is
  wrong — scrolling/rotating a built-in texture by hand works today. **Split:** the only missing half is the
  animation-track target → re-scoped as `B1-anim` (next) with all extension points mapped + a renderer
  foundation step (store `TextureTransform` in the SlotMap + a getter; prototyped then reverted to keep this
  commit clean — no functional code change this iteration). Next: B1-anim.
- 2026-06-21 — **B1-anim DONE (animate the UV transform) — PASS (live).** Full feature across renderer +
  scene + scene-loader + editor: SlotMap stores `TextureTransform` (+ getter); `AnimationTarget::TextureUv`
  + `TexSlot`/`TexTransformProp`; apply with on-demand identity-seed + read-modify-write (offset/scale vec2,
  rotation scalar); `read_rest`; lowering in both player + editor paths; Add-Track rows + all display sites.
  311 unit tests green. Verified live: imported BoxTextured.glb, animated base_color UV offset `[0,0]→[1,0]`,
  scrubbed → texture visibly scrolls in U (t=0 vs t=0.5 screenshots), zero GPU errors; on-demand identity
  seed proven (imported tex had no transform). B1 is now fully complete (settable+UI + animation). Next: B2.
- 2026-06-21 — **B2 DONE (PBR scalars normal_scale + occlusion_strength) — PASS (live).** Added both to
  BuiltinParamKind/BuiltinMaterialParam, wired settable+animatable across scene/renderer/scene-loader/editor/MCP
  (patch + apply + read_rest + resolvers + readback + Add-Track rows + set_builtin_param tool). 311 tests green.
  Verified live: imported NormalTangentTest.glb; set_builtin_param(normal_scale,0) → node_kind_details readback
  = 0; a normal_scale track 3→0 visibly flattens the normal-mapped detail (t=0 vs t=1 screenshots), zero GPU
  errors. Type-specific knobs (emissive_strength/cutoff/toon/flipbook) split as B2-extra (deferred, needs
  per-feature plumbing). Next: B3.
- 2026-06-21 — **B3 DEFERRED (optional texture-flow convenience) — value call.** The auto-scrolling-texture
  capability is already delivered + live-verified via B1-anim (a looping UV-offset track scrolls a built-in
  texture, proven on BoxTextured.glb). B3 only adds the "set a velocity, no clip" convenience. Ruled out a
  shader-flow (`frame_globals_raw` bound per-pass; `textures.wgsl` is pass-agnostic) in favor of a CPU-flow
  design (scene `TextureRef.flow` + renderer flow registry + `advance_texture_flows(dt)` in update_animations
  + bridge + UI) — recorded turnkey. Deferred in favor of the higher-value D1/D3/P2/U2. No code change.
  Next: D1.
- 2026-06-21 — **D1 `ibl` include DONE (the report's "biggest win") — PASS (live).** New Tier-A `ibl`
  include (bit + const + KEY_TABLE + all() + direct_deps in shader_includes.rs; `ibl` gate in
  ShaderIncludeFlags; self-contained `lighting/ibl.wgsl` `sample_ibl(...)` over the always-bound IBL
  cubemaps/LUT + get_lights_info; gated into the opaque kernel). naga regression test added
  (custom_material_ibl_include_validates). Verified live: a custom material declaring `["ibl"]`, fragment
  returns ONLY sample_ibl, IBL-only scene → box is environment-lit (orange w/ sky-irradiance shading, NOT
  black), ok:true, zero GPU errors — the report's repro fixed. **Split:** `normal_map`/TBN → `D1-normalmap`
  (DEFERRED): the dynamic OpaqueShadingInput has no `tangents` field, so it first needs tangents plumbed
  into the visibility-buffer shade kernel (gated on FragmentInputs::TANGENTS) before a build_tbn/
  perturb_normal include — kernel attribute work, separable. Next: D3.

## Appendix — original third-party handoff (verbatim, for traceability)

> The text below is the report as received. It is **superseded** by the verified tasks above where they
> disagree; kept only so each ask is traceable to its origin. Item codes (B1–B3, A1–A2, D1–D3, P1–P2,
> U1–U3) map 1:1 to the tasks above.

### 1 — Built-in material capabilities
- **B1.** Animatable per-texture UV transform (offset/scale/rotation) on built-in materials (PBR, unlit,
  toon, flipbook); settable param **and** animation-track target; aligns with glTF `KHR_texture_transform`.
- **B2.** Broaden animatable built-in params beyond `base_color | metallic | roughness | emissive`
  (normal_scale, emissive_strength, occlusion, alpha cutoff, UV transform, toon ramp, flipbook fps/offset).
- **B3.** First-class texture flow/scroll (direction + speed) advanced automatically; thin convenience over
  B1. Content caveat: needs a continuous UV axis; editor should detect-and-warn on baked/tiled geometry.

### 2 — Animation system
- **A1.** Add `vec2` / `vec4` keyframe + uniform-track value kinds (today only `vec3 | quat | scalar`).
- **A2.** Accept an optional `interp` on `add_keyframe` (today keys default; setting interp needs a 2nd call).

### 3 — Dynamic-material ergonomics
- **D1.** Expose general lighting building blocks behind `includes`: `ibl` (sample_ibl: diffuse irradiance
  + specular prefilter + BRDF LUT) and `normal_map`/TBN (supply TBN when `tangents` requested /
  `perturb_normal`). Explicitly NOT a "reimplement/fork PBR" helper.
- **D2.** BUG: malformed `MaterialData` constructor when a scalar precedes a `vec2` (alignment padding in
  struct but not constructor → whole Material-Opaque module fails → meshes render black); AND diagnostics
  lie (WGSL-set returned ok / diagnostics `{registered:true, ok:true, errors:[]}` despite a GPU
  `CreateShaderModule` validation error). Fix padding codegen; make diagnostics reflect the actual GPU
  pipeline-creation outcome.
- **D3.** Setting a material uniform affects only the DEFAULT, not the live value (only takes effect on
  re-register or via an animation track). Write the live uniform buffer (or add an explicit `*_live`
  variant and document the distinction).

### 4 — Editor / runtime papercuts
- **P1.** Camera control appears locked while a clip is "current"; gizmo persists after clearing selection;
  clearing the current clip restores camera control. Allow camera framing in clip-edit mode (or document);
  let "clear selection" remove the gizmo.
- **P2.** "Frame node" can place the camera inside the subject (extreme interior close-up). Revisit the fit
  math / expose a min-distance.

### 5 — Editor UX: animation editor
- **U1.** Overall: the GUI clip-authoring flow is not discoverable/usable ("right now it's unusable").
- **U2.** No visible selection context while animating — bring an outliner / scene-tree into the animation
  context (collapsible); selection visible and shared between scene and animation editing.
- **U3.** No visible way to add tracks — an obvious "add track" affordance covering material params,
  node/mesh transforms, lights, cameras, morphs, custom-material uniforms, driven off the current selection.
