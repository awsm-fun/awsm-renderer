//! Procedural **modifier stack** — the editable mesh *recipe* (Phase 3).
//!
//! A modifier stack is a non-destructive recipe: a [`MeshBase`] generator plus an
//! ordered list of [`Modifier`] deformers. It is tiny, infinitely re-editable
//! project data; the baked `.mesh.bin` triangle buffer is a regenerable cache.
//! Evaluation (recipe → `MeshData`) lives in `awsm-meshgen` (`modifiers::evaluate`),
//! which is pure-CPU and natively unit-tested.
//!
//! Stored on [`MeshDef::modifiers`](super::material::MeshDef::modifiers)
//! (`#[serde(default)]`, so captured meshes without a recipe — raw-edited /
//! collapsed — round-trip with `None`).
