//! Material **prep** pass — the shared, material-independent per-pixel resolve
//! that Plan B introduces (`docs/plans/deferred-shared-prep-pass.md`).
//!
//! It runs once over the visibility buffer (after classify, before per-material
//! shading) and materializes everything that is the *same regardless of
//! material*: world position, interpolated UV sets + vertex colors, and the
//! per-pixel shadow-visibility terms. Per-material kernels then read those
//! buffers instead of recomputing them, so the per-material module shrinks.
//!
//! Stage 0 lands [`PrepPassConfig`] — the build-time knobs every later stage
//! keys on. The pass shader scaffold lives in [`shader`]; its buffers, bind
//! groups, and dispatch wiring arrive in the subsequent stages (see the spec's
//! "Implementation stages").
